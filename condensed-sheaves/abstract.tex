We build, in a constructive meta theory, a higher topos corresponding to the light condensed sets of Scholze and Clausen.
Like in the classical picture, the base category is the category of countably presented Boolean algebras, with a suitable Grothendieck topology.
The first step is to build a cubical presheaf model over this category. It is an adaptation of Christian Sattler's cubical model of univalent type theory, which validates dependent choice. The second step consists in using internal lex modalities to build a submodel satisfying the following axioms, where B is any countably presented boolean algebras:

- Axiom 1 (Duality): The canonical map B -> (Sp(B) -> 2) is an isomorphism, where Sp(B) = Hom(B,2).

- Axiom 2 (Completeness): If B is a non-trivial then Sp(B) is merely inhabited.

- Axiom 3 (Local choice): Given a surjective map p : X -> Sp(B) there merely exists B' and an injective map
i : B -> B' with a section s : Sp(B') -> X such that Sp(i) = ps.

- Axiom 4: Dependent Choice

As shown in an accompanying paper, those axioms seem sufficient to develop purely internally properties of light condensed sets.
