We build, in a constructive meta theory, a higher topos corresponding to light condensed sets
of Scholze and Clausen.
Like in the classical picture, the base category is the category of countably presented Boolean
algebras, with a suitable Grothendieck topology.
The first step is to build a presheaf model. It is an adaptation of Christian Sattler's model
of univalent type theory which validates dependent choice. The second step consists in using
internal lex modalities to build a new model satisfying the following:

-Axiom 1 (duality): for countably presented Boolean algebras B, the canonical map B -> (Sp(B) -> 2)
is an isomorphism, where Sp(B) = Hom(B,2)

-Axiom 2 (completness): if B non trivial countable presented Boolean algebra then Sp(B) is merely inhabited

-Axiom 3 (local choice): given a surjective map p : X -> Sp(B) there exists B' and an injective map
i : B -> B' with a section s : Sp(B') -> X such that Sp(i) = p o s

-Axiom 4: Dependent Choice

As shown in an accompanying paper, we show that those axioms seem sufficient to develop 
properties of light condensed sets that are internally valid.
