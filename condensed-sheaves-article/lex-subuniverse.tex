Assume given a lex modality $L$ in homotopy type theory. Then we can interpret any statement in homotopy type theory in the universe of modal types. The precise details can be found in \rednote{TODO Kevin Quirin PhD Lawvere-Tierney sheafification in Homotopy Type Theory}. The idea is to give a translation from sequent to sequent. We just give a summary of the translation of any type $A$ as a modal type $[A]_L$.

\begin{eqnarray}
{[\mathrm{Type}]_L} &\equiv& \sum_{X:\mathrm{Type}} X\ \mathrm{is\ modal}\\
{[\prod_{x:A}B(x)]_L} &\equiv& \prod_{x:[A]_L}[B]_L(x)\\
{[\sum_{x:A}B(x)]_L} &\equiv& \sum_{x:[A]_L}[B]_L(x)\\
{[x=_Ay]_L} &\equiv& [x]_L=_{[A]_L}[y]_L\\
{[\propTrunc{A}]_L} &\equiv& L\propTrunc{[A]_L}
\end{eqnarray}

This means we mostly leave things untouched expect we assume type variables to be modal, and use the modal replacement on the propositional truncation. This translation is extended to contexts and terms in the expected way.

\rednote{To my knowledge, there is no general schema for extending this translation to higher inductive types in general. TODO what solution?}

%Then for any inductive type $\mathbb{I}$ (without type parameter) we have that:

%\begin{eqnarray}
%{[\mathbb{I}]_L} &\simeq& L(\mathbb{I})\\
%\end{eqnarray}

%Note that we do not use equality and just an equivalence, for computational reasons.
