\title{Cohomology in Synthetic Stone Duality}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
Peter Scholze and Dustin Clausen \cite{Scholze} introduced light condensed sets, defined as sheaves on the site of profinite sets, which can be used as an alternative to topological spaces. 
An extension of homotopy type theory by axioms called synthetic Stone duality was introduced in \cite{synthetic-stone-duality}. This extension implies some results about the first integral cohomology groups. More precisely, we have that $H^1(S,\Z) = 0$ for $S$ a Stone space, that $H^1(X,\Z)$ for $X$ compact Hausdorff can be computed using \v{C}ech cohomology and that $H^1(\mathbb{I},\Z) = 0$ where $\mathbb{I}$ is the unit interval \cite{synthetic-stone-duality}. In this talk we will present the extension of these results to higher cohomology groups with non-constant countably presented abelian groups as coefficients. Those are synthetic analogues of results from Roy Dyckhoff \cite{dyckhoff76,dyckhoff76-1}.

\subsection*{Synthetic Stone Duality}

In traditional topology, Stone spaces are defined as totally disconnected Hausdorff spaces, or equivalently as profinite sets. In synthetic Stone duality, Stone spaces are precisely (countable) sequential limits of finite sets, which means there is a size restriction on the considered Stone spaces, making this setting analogous to \emph{light} condensed sets. 

The axioms of synthetic Stone duality postulate Stone duality (Stone spaces are equivalent to countably presented Boolean algebras), completeness (non-empty Stone spaces are merely inhabited), dependent choice and a \emph{local-choice} axiom. The latter is the only axiom mentioning higher types, it says that given a Stone space $S$ and a type family $B$ over $S$ such that $\Pi_{x:S} \| B(x)  \|$, there merely is a Stone space $T$ and a surjection $s:T\to S$ such that $\Pi_{x:T} B(s(x))$. Local choice is crucial when performing the cohomological computations mentioned below.

Many traditional properties of Stone spaces can be shown synthetically, sometimes phrased in a more type-theoretic way, e.g. Stone spaces are closed under $\Sigma$-types. Open and closed propositions can be defined, inducing a topology on any type such that any map is continuous. This topology is as expected for Stone spaces and compact Hausdorff spaces (i.e. quotient of Stone spaces by closed equivalence relations).

One important example of compact Hausdorff space is the real interval $\I$, from which the type $\R$  of real numbers is constructed.
As in \cite{shulman-Brouwer-fixed-point}, it is important to distinguish topological spaces like $\bS^1:=\{(x,y):\R^2\vert x^2+y^2=1\}$ from homotopical spaces like the higher inductive 1-type $S^1$.

Despite topological spaces being sets, they can have non-trivial cohomology. Indeed, for any type $X$ and dependent abelian group $A:X\to \mathrm{Ab}$, we use the usual synthetic definition of the $n$-th cohomology group $H^n(X,A)$ as $\|\Pi_{x:X}K(A_x,n)\|_0$ where $K(A_x,n)$ is the $n$-th Eilenberg Mac-Lane space with coefficient $A_x$. In \cite{synthetic-stone-duality}, it is proven that $H^1(\bS^1,\Z)=\Z$, despite $\bS^1$ being a set.

\subsection*{Barton and Commelin's condensed type theory}

Reid Barton and Johann Commelin proposed an extension of type theory called condensed type theory. It postulates two classes of types called compact Hausdorff spaces and overtly discrete types, with certain duality axioms relating them. We prove the axioms of Barton and Commelin in synthetic Stone duality, defining compact Hausdorff spaces as quotients of Stone spaces by closed equivalence relations and overtly discrete types as sequential colimits of finite types.

An abelian group is overtly discrete if and only if it is countably presented, and we will use these groups as coefficients for cohomology. The following are crucial for our results:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Barton and Commelin's dual to Tychonoff: For any compact Hausdorff space $X$ and any family of overtly discrete types $B_x$ for $x:X$, the dependent product $\Pi_{x:X}B(x)$ is overtly discrete.
\item A generalisation of both Barton and Commelin's Scott continuity and factorisation axioms: Given sequences of compact Hausdorff spaces $(C_k)_{k:\N}$ and overtly discrete types $(I_i)_{i:\N}$, we have that:
\[\mathrm{colim}_{k,i}(C_k\to I_i) \simeq \left(\mathrm{lim}_kC_k \to \mathrm{colim}_iI_i\right)\]
We call it generalised Scott continuity.
\item A dependent version of generalised Scott-continuity, to account for non-constant cohomology coefficients.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Vanishing of higher cohomology of Stone spaces}

First we prove that $H^1(S,A) = 0$ with $S$ Stone and  $A : S\to \mathrm{Ab}_{\mathrm{cp}}$. We assume $\alpha:\prod_{x:S}K(A_x,1)$, by local choice we get a surjection $p:T\twoheadrightarrow S$ with $T$ Stone which trivialises $\alpha$. Then we get an approximation of $p$ as a sequential limit of surjective maps $p_k:T_k\to S_k$ between finite sets, we check that the induced trivialisation over $T_k$ gives a trivialisation over $S_k$, and conclude through the dependent version of generalised Scott Continuity that $\alpha$ is trivial over $\mathrm{lim}_kS_k =S$.

We follow an idea due to David W\"arn \cite{cech-draft}[Theorem 3.4] to go from $H^1(S,A)=0$ to $H^n(S,A)=0$ for $n>1$. The key idea is to proceed by induction on $n$, generalising the induction hypothesis from $H^n(S,A) = 0$ to: 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $K(\prod_{x:S}A_x,n) \to \prod_{x:S}K(A_x,n)$ is an equivalence, directly implying $H^n(S,A)=0$.
\item $K(\prod_{x:S}A_x,n+1) \to \prod_{x:S}K(A_x,n+1)$ is an embedding.
\end{enumerate}
Assume (i) and (ii) for $n-1>0$, let's prove (i) and (ii) for $n$. (ii) follows immediately from induction hypothesis (i). To prove (i), by induction hypothesis (ii) it is enough to prove that $\prod_{x:S}K(A_x,n)$ is connected, i.e. $H^n(S,A)=0$. We assume $\alpha:\prod_{x:S}K(A_x,n)$, by local choice we get a trivialisation $p:T\twoheadrightarrow S$ of $\alpha$ with $T$ Stone. Denoting by $T_x$ the fiber of $p$ over $x$ , we consider the exact sequence:
\[0\to A_x\to A_x^{T_x}\to L_x\to 0\]
giving an exact sequence:
\[H^{n-1}(S,L)\to H^n(S,A)\to H^n(S,\lambda x. A_x^{T_x})\]
By induction hypothesis (i) we have that $H^{n-1}(S,L) = 0$ so we have an injection:
\[H^n(S,A)\to H^n(S,\lambda x. A_x^{T_x})\]
By induction hypothesis (ii) the map: 
\[H^n(S,\lambda x. A_x^{T_x}) \to H^n(\Sigma_{x:S}T_x,A_x) = H^n(T,A\circ p)\]
is an injection and we get an injection:
\[p^* : H^n(S,A)\to H^n(T,A\circ p)\] 
But $p$ trivialise $\alpha$ so $p^*(\alpha)=0$, therefore $\alpha=0$.

\subsection*{\v{C}ech cohomology for compact Hausdorff spaces}

Given a compact Hausforff space $X$, a \v{C}ech cover for $X$ consists of a Stone space $S$ and a surjective map $p:S\twoheadrightarrow X$. By definition any compact Hausdorff space has a \v{C}ech cover.

Given such a \v{C}ech cover and $A:X\to \mathrm{Ab}_{\mathrm{cp}}$, we define its \v{C}ech complex as:
\[\Pi_{x:X}A_x^{S_x} \to \Pi_{x:X}A_x^{S_x\times S_x} \to \cdots\]
with the boundary maps defined as expected, and its \v{C}ech cohomology $\check{H}^k(X,A)$ as the $k$-th homology group of its \v{C}ech complex. It is clear that $H^0(X,A) = \check{H}^0(X,A)$.
%\[\delta(\alpha)(x,u_0,\cdots,u_n) = \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i\alpha(x,u_0,\cdots,\hat{u_i},\cdots,u_n)\]

From vanishing, for $n>0$ we get an exact sequences:
\[H^{n-1}(X,\lambda x.A_x^{S_x}) \to H^{n-1}(X,L)\to H^n(X,A)\to 0\]
By the usual long exact sequence argument and direct computations, for $n>0$ we get exact sequences:
\[\check{H}^{n-1}(X,\lambda x.A_x^{S_x}) \to \check{H}^{n-1}(X,L)\to \check{H}^n(X,A)\to 0\]

We conclude by induction on $n$ that $H^n(X,A) = \check{H}^n(X,A)$ for all $n$, so that in particular \v{C}ech cohomology does not depend on the \v{C}ech cover. For this induction to go through it is crucial that $A_x^{S_x}$ is overtly discrete, which follows from the dual to Tychonoff.

Using finite approximations to the \v{C}ech cover $2^\N\to \mathbb{I}$, we can check that $H^n(\mathbb{I},A) = 0$ for all $n>0$ and $A:\mathbb{I}\to \mathrm{Ab}_{\mathrm{cp}}$.
