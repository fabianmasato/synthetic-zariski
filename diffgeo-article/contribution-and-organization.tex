We give concise descriptions of some common differential geometric notions used in algebraic geometry.
In sythetic algebraic geometry it is often possible to reason pointwise.
One consequence is that we can use a pointwise defintion of formally étale maps,
where we use what we call \emph{closed dense propositions} in a role where, classically we would have infinitesimal extensions of affine schemes.
As intermediate tools, which are interesting on their on, we describe a surprising internal duality of modules over the internal base ring, which corresponds to the affine line in the classical picture.
We show that our definitions agree with commonly known concrete, global descriptions of smooth, étale and unramified schemes.
