\title{Severi-Brauer Varieties}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

{F}ran\c cois {C}h\^atelet introduced the notion of Severi-Brauer variety in his 1944 PhD thesis
\cite{chatelet44} in order to generalise of a result of Poincar\'e about rational curves over a field.
He defines a Severi-Brauer variety to be a variety which becomes isomorphic to some $\bP^n$ after
a separable extension. After recalling the characterisation of a central simple algebra over a field $k$, as
an algebra which becomes isomorphic to a matrix algebra $M_n(k)$ after a separable extension, he notices the fundamental
fact that, $\bP^{n+1}(k)$ and $M_n(k)$ have the same automorphism group $PGL_{n}(k)$. He uses then this
to describe a correspondence between Severi-Brauer varieties and central simple algebras, and as a corollary
obtains the following generalisation of Poincar\'e's result: a Severi-Brauer variety which has a rational point
is isomorphic to some $\bP^{n+1}(k)$. This result and its proof are described in Serre's book on local fields \cite{serre62}.
(The paper \cite{colliot88} contains also a description of this result.)

The notion of central simple algebra over a field
has been generalised to the notion of Azumaya algebra  \cite{azumaya51}, and
Grothendieck \cite{grothendieck68} generalized the notion of Severi-Brauer over over an arbitrary comuutative ring.
The goal of this note is to present a formulation and proof of Ch\^atelet's Theorem over an arbitrary commutative ring
in the setting of synthetic algebraic geometry \cite{draft}, using the results already proved about projective
space \cite{sag-projective} in this context, in particular the fact that any automorphism of the projective space is given
by a homography. We make essential use of basic results about dependent type theory with univalence \cite{hott}
and modalities \cite{modalities}, in particular the fact that, in this context, fppf and \'etale topology can be described
as modalities. The formulation of Ch\^atelet's Theorem becomes then
\[\propTrunc{X=\bP^n}_{T} \to \propTrunc{X} \to \propTrunc{X=\bP^n}\]
where:
\[\propTrunc{X=\bP^n}_{T}\]
is the localisation of $\propTrunc{X=\bP^n}$ for a modality $T$ satisfying some basic properties (valid for the modality
corresponding to \'etale topology).
