\begin{lemma}
  Any function $2^\N\to 2^\N$ is continuous. 
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof}
  Let $\overline f : 2^\N \to 2^\N$. 
  Assume $m :\N$. We will give an $n:\N$ such that 
  whenever $a=_n b$, we have $\overline f(a) =_m \overline f(b)$. 

  By Stone duality, there is some $f: C \to C$ such that $\overline f = Sp(f)$. 
  For any atom $p_j\in C$, we have that $f(p_j)$ is a finite Boolean combination
  of atoms of $C$.
  Therefore the set $\{f(p_j)|_{j\leq m}\} $ can be expressed using only
  finitely many atoms, so there is an $n$ such that we can express 
  all elements in this set with $(p_i)_{i\leq n}$. 

  Now suppose $a=_n b$, then $a(p_i) = b(p_i)$ for any $i \leq n$. 
  Therefore $a(f(p_j)) = b(f(p_j))$ whenever $j\leq m$. 
  Therefore $f(a) =_m f(b)$, as required. 


\end{proof}
