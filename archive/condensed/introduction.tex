TODO

\rednote{Right now I'm throwing texts relating our stuff to the literature here.}

In formal/point-free topology \cite{TODO}, 
we consider that a Boolean algebra $B$ represents a Stone space $Sp(B)$ and a map
$Sp(B') \to Sp(B)$ is represented by a map $B\rightarrow B'$; 
the map $Sp(B')\to Sp(B)$ is then said to be
{\em formally surjective} if the corresponding map $B\to B'$ is injective. 
In the topos of light condensed sets,this becomes a true duality, 
as we shall see in \Cref{FormalSurjectionsAreSurjections}.
