\subsection{The topology of the interval}
We have defined the interval as a certain quotient of Cantor space, 
in \Cref{IntervalvsCauchyInterval}, a proof is provided for the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}
  Let $I'$ denote the interval of Cauchy real numbers.
  Then the map $2^\N\to I'$ given by 
  \begin{equation}
    \alpha \mapsto \bigsum\limits_{i\in \N} \frac{\alpha(i)} {2^{i+1}}
  \end{equation}
  is well-defined and induces an equivalence $I\simeq I'$. 
\end{theorem}
