Title: Synthetic Stone duality

Abstract: We present an axiomatization for the (higher) topos of light condensed sets in dependent type theory with univalence, similar to the axiomatization of the (higher) Zariski topos in synthetic algebraic geometry. Stone spaces correspond to affine schemes, and compact Hausdorff spaces correspond to schemes. We can show that all maps between compact Hausdorff spaces are continuous, hence the negation of the weak principle of omniscience holds. We can prove the limited principle of omniscience and Markov's principle. We expect to be able to prove from these axioms that the higher cohomology over Z of any Stone spaces is trivial and that the cohomology over Z of any compact Hausdorff spaces is the same as the singular cohomology.
