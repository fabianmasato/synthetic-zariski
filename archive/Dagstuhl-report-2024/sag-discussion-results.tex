\subsection{Finiteness}
Ingo Blechschmidt proved, that finite schemes are noetherian sets.
Quasi-finiteness was discussed.
The results are recorded here \cite{finite-draft}.

\subsection{Overtness}
With Andrej Bauer and Martín Escardó we discussed overtness in synthetic algebraic geometry and found some results recorded in \cite{random-draft}[Section 12].
