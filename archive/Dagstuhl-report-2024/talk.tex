This joint talk of Matthias Hutzler and Felix Cherubini introduced the audience to the new topic of synthetic algebraic geometry. There is a recent, extensive article on the foundations of this subject written by the two speakers and Thierry Coquand available \cite{draft}, also as part of a larger collection of notes on various branches of the subject \cite{sag-project}.

After giving an introduction in which we tried to acknowledge the variations of backgrounds of the group, we decided to focus on the topic of finite schemes. One hope was, that this might lead to new ideas in connecting the geometric-algebraic notion of a \emph{finite} schemes with finiteness notions in constructive mathematics.
