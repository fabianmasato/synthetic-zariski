We use work from Ingo Blechschmidt's PhD thesis, section 18 as a basis.
This includes in particular the synthetic quasi-coherence axiom and the assumption that the base ring is local.
David Jaz Myers had the idea to use Blechschmidt's ideas in homotopy type theory
and presented his ideas 2019 at the workshop ``Geometry in Modal Homotopy Type Theory'' in Pittsburgh.
Myers ideas include the algebra-setup we used in our formalization.

In December 2022, there was a mini-workshop in Augsburg, which helped with the development of this work.
We thank Jonas HÃ¶fer, Lukas Stoll and Fabian Endres for spotting a couple of small errors and Evan Cavallo for simplifying a proof.
