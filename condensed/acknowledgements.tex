The idea to use the topological characterization of stone spaces as totally disconnected, compact Hausdorff spaces to prove \Cref{stone-sigma-closed} was explained to us by Martín Escardó.

David Wärn noticed that Markov's principle (\Cref{MarkovPrinciple}) holds. 
At TYPES 2024, we had an interesting discussion with Bas Spitters on the topic of the article.
