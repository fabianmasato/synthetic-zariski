We consider a modification of synthetical algebraic geometry (SAG) which we call synthetic Stone duality.
This means that we work in homotopy type theory with additional axioms.
We get an axiom system strong enough to prove Markov's principle, LLPO and the negation of WLPO. 
We also introduce types of open and closed propositions. 
This leads to a (synthetic) topological study of Stone and compact Hausdorff types. 
These types are all closed under dependent sums and equality types. 
All functions are continuous, and the topology is as one would classically expect.
This induces a interval type of real numbers on which all functions are continuous.
We use the synthetic homotopy theory given by the higher types of homotopy type theory to make homotopical arguments.
We can calculate the cohomology of the interval and use this to prove Brouwer's fixed point theorem.
