We will consider a modification of synthetical algebraic geometry (SAG) which we call synthetic Stone duality.
We get an axiom system strong enough to prove Markov's principle, LLPO and the negtion of WLPO. 
We also introduce types of open and closed propositions. 
This leads to a (synthetic) topological study of Stone and compact Hausdorff types. 
These types are all closed under dependent sums and equality types. 
All functions are continuous, and the topology is as one would classically expect.
This induces a interval type of real numbers on which all functions are continuous. 
We can calculate the cohomology of the interval and use this to prove Brouwer's fixed point theorem.
