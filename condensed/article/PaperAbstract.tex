The language of homotopy type theory has proved to be an appropriate internal language for various higher toposes, 
for example for the Zariski topos in Synthetic Algebraic Geometry. This paper aims to do the same for the higher topos of light condensed anima of Dustin Clausen and Peter Scholze. This seems to be an appropriate setting for synthetic topology in the style of Martín Escardó.
To do this, we use homotopy type theory extended with 4 axioms. Our axioms are strong enough to prove Markov's principle, LLPO and the negation of WLPO. 
We also define a type of open propositions, inducing a topology on any type. This leads to a synthetic topological study of (second countable) Stone and compact Hausdorff spaces. 
Indeed all functions are continuous in the sense that they respect this induced topology, and this topology is as expected for these classes of types.
For example, any map from the unit interval to itself is continuous in the usual epsilon-delta sense.
We also use the synthetic homotopy theory 
given by the higher types of homotopy type theory to define and 
work with cohomology.
As an application, we prove Brouwer's fixed-point theorem
internally.
