The idea to use the topological characterization of stone spaces as totally disconnected, compact Hausdorff spaces to prove \Cref{stone-sigma-closed} was explained to us by Martín Escardó. More precisely, he gave us a proof of the following topological theorem, which we were able to adapt to our setting:\\

\,\textbf{Theorem}\\
  If $f : X \to S$ is a continuous map into a Stone space and all fibers of $f$ are Stone spaces, then the topological space X is totally disconnected. \\

David Wärn noticed that Markov's principle (\Cref{MarkovPrinciple}) holds. 
At TYPES 2024, Bas Spitters asked whether equality is an apartness relation, 
which became \Cref{StoneEqualityApartness}.
