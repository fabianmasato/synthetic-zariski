In this section we compute $H^1(S,\Z) = 0$ for $S$ Stone, and show that $H^1(X,\Z)$ for $X$ compact Hausdorff can be computed using \v{C}ech cohomology. We then apply this to compute $H^1(\I,\Z)=0$. We work on the first cohomology group with coefficient in $\Z$ as it is sufficient for the proof of Brouwer theorem, but the results could be extended to $H^n(X,A)$ for $A$ a family of overtly discrete abelian groups indexed by $X$.

\subsection{Preliminary}

\begin{definition}
Given a map $T\to S$ and $M:S\to \mathrm{Ab}$, then we define $C(S,T)$ as the chain complex:
\[\prod_{x:S}\Z^{T_x} \to \prod_{x:S}\Z^{T_x^2}\to \prod_{x:S}\Z^{T_x^3}\]
with TODO
\end{definition}
