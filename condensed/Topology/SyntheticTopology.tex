\subsection{Types as spaces}
The subobject $\Open$ of the type of propositions induces a topology on every type. 
This is the viewpoint taken in synthetic topology. 
We will follow the terminology of \cite{SyntheticTopologyEscardo, SyntheticTopologyLesnik}. 
%other references include \cite{SyntheticTopologyEscardo}%, TODOSortOutTaylorsReferences}.
%Defining a topology in this way has some benefits, which we summarize in this section. 

\begin{definition}
  Let $T$ be a type, and let $A\subseteq T$ be a subtype. 
  We call $A\subseteq T$ open or closed iff $A(t)$ is open or closed respectively for all $t:T$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  It follows immediately that the pre-image of an open by any map of types sends is open, so that any map is continuous. 
%  This is only relevant for a space if the topology we defined above matches the topology one would expect. 
  In \Cref{StoneClosedSubsets}, we shall see that the resulting topology is as expected for second countable Stone spaces.
  In \Cref{IntervalTopologyStandard}, we shall see that the same for the unit interval. 
\end{remark}
